# Vaccination-Maps

A map engine I created using publicly avaiable health data whih covered various vaccination programmes broken down at ICB level. <br>
The engine helped significantly in allowing me to protype and demonstrate various methods of shading along with colour schemes for each. <br> 
Through 3 iterations we landed on some final products that blended NHS colour schemes with the performance scale. <br>

## The components needed to achieve this are: <br>
**csv** - this allows control of the parameters
**geopandas and geojson** - for plotting the boundaries
**data**  - a dataset that has values with a geography id column that matches the id in the geojson
**python notebook** - a python notebook for applying the transformations and reading in the control csv, data and geojson.
